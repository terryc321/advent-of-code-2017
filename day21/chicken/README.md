## relax and use lisp lists 

no reason to go vector heavy

## specific orientation 

puzzle still really kicking my arse - part 2 

reason orientation matters is the pattern is split multiple times between pairs and triples

specific pattern_A must give a unique pattern_B

cannot have all rotations and flips of pattern A yield one single pattern B_0 

if pattern A matches and leads to pattern B 

pattern A has a specific orientation as does pattern B 
not enough to simply dump pattern B out , as that is B_specific to A_specific

so the patterns themselves must be taken account of.

there are EIGHT at most pattern orientations .

this puzzle is really kicking my arse

main issue is
 - lack of debugging
 - lack of user interaction / gui interface
 -
 
if we write interpreter for the language we wish to use
 -


this is a tricky bugger of a problem

lots of moving parts
