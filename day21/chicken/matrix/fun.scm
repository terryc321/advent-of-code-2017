matrix in lisp
hash table then use key (1 1) say

if matrix width is divisble by 2
2 4 6 8 10 12 ...
break matrix up into 2 x 2 squares converted to 3x3 squares
think of 2 x 2 squares being already in place
insert blank rows and blank columns every nth row ,

keep track of largest element set so far ?
or do we just do a copy of matrix (a hash) and leave blank spaces #f falsies
in place

show matrix facility row 1 , col 1 .. N
... ron N , col 1 ... N
matrices are always square

if we do check and replace 2x2 by 3x3 when matrix has been expanded ( post expansion )
then the 3x3 matrix can then be slotted in place
