oh boy this was a real long slog

major issue is basic scheme lisp lacks loop constructs , 
 means have to divert cognition to scheme macros , which is just ridiculous
  scheme lacks a matrix or any 2 d grid out the box
  
  problem mainly trying to solve a difficult problem using a vanilla lisp that 
  offers 
  cond car cdr define let let* letrec lambda 
  
  then just kinda walks off in a huff ...
